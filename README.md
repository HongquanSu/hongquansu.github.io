## Project topic

Mapping the Galaxy in 3-D using observations of HII region absorption with the MWA

## Project details

Synchrotron emission pervades the Galactic plane at low radio frequencies, originating from cosmic ray electrons interacting with the Galactic magnetic field. Using a low-frequency radio telescope, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), I measure the free-free absorption of this Galactic synchrotron emission by intervening HII regions along the line of sight. These absorption measurements allow me to calculate the Galactic cosmic-ray electron emissivity behind and in front of HII regions. This will enable testing of the spatial distribution of cosmic-ray electrons with a known Galactic magnetic field.

## Project progress

The initial measurements have been reported:
Galactic synchrotron emissivity measurements between 250° < l < 355° from the GLEAM survey with the MWA
